# ConsensusFilters
Consensus Filters for Sensor Networks

This is the second project of CS791X. 
As a requirement, I designed a network of 10 nodes in 4 X 4 area (Case 1) and 30 nodes in 12 X 12 area (Case 2) where 2 types of Consensus filters has been implemented. 
For Case 1, I’ve implemented two weight design while estimating for single cell.
For Case 2, I’ve estimated Consensus for multiple cells. 
This project develops the Consensus filter in Matlab.
